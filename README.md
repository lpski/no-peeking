# No Peeking
No Peeking is a macOS Menu Bar app built with SwiftUI. Made for your coffee-shop working needs, it detects nosy onlookers that are peeking at your screen via gaze detection and subtly notifies you via the menu bar icon.

## Setup
For now, to run the app just clone the repo & build/install the application in xcode.
